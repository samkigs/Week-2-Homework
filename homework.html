                <h1>AKAN NAMES</h1>
    
                <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.
                    Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first
                    name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week 
                    they were born. Here are Ghanian Day Names.

        <p>-And since a lot of people do know when their birthdays
            are, unfortunately there are some who are oblivious to when
            their birthdays are. 
            
        </p>

        <p>-Luckily, I have designed a calculator that will help determine the 
            birthdates of those who are of Ghanian roots. This is how it works
