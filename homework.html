        <h1>AKAN NAMES</h1>

        <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.
            Frequently ni Ghana, children are given their first
            name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week 
            they were born. Here are Ghanian Day Names.
        </p>
        <h2>Males</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sunday: Kwasi</li>
            <li>Monday: Kwadwo</li>
            <li>Tuesday: Kwabena</li>
            <li>Wednesday: Kwaku</li>
            <li>Thursday: Yaw</li>
            <li>Friday: Kofi</li>
            <li>Saturday: Kwame</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Females</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sunday: Akosua</li>
            <li>Monday: Adwoa</li>
            <li>Tuesday: Abenaa</li>
            <li>Wednesday: Akua</li>
            <li>Thursday:  Yaa</li>
            <li>Friday: Afua</li>
            <li>Saturday: Ama</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And since a lot of people do know when their birthdays
            are, unfortunately there are some who are oblivious to when
            their birthdays are. 
            
        </p>

        <p>Luckily, I have designed a calculator that will help determine the 
            birthdates of those who are of Ghanian roots.
